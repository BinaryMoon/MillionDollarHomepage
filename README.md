# Million Dollar Homepage

Inspired by the article [A Million Squandered: The “Million Dollar Homepage” as a Decaying Digital Artifact](http://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2017/07/21/a-million-squandered-the-million-dollar-homepage-as-a-decaying-digital-artifact/) I thought it would be interesting to recreate the Million Dollar Homepage linking to the pages - as they were in 2005 when the site was first launched.

So, using the power of [The Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/), I have made this site.

Unfortunately, because of robots.txt rules, not all of the sites have been stored on the Way Back Machine but this restores much of the content so we can keep a piece of internet history alive.

To see what else I get up to you can visit [my personal blog](https://www.binarymoon.co.uk).
