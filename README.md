# Million Dollar Homepage

Inspired by the article (A Million Squandered: The “Million Dollar Homepage” as a Decaying Digital Artifact)[http://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2017/07/21/a-million-squandered-the-million-dollar-homepage-as-a-decaying-digital-artifact/] I thought it would be interesting to recreate the Million Dollar Homepage linking to the pages - as they were in 2005 when the site was first launched.

So, using the power of (The Way Back Machine)[https://archive.org/web/], I have made this site.
